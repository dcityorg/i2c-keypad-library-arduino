#### Short Description:
This library works with Arduino and Particle (Photon, Electron, and Core) microcontroller boards and it provides many functions to communicate with matrix keypads that have the MCP230008 I²C interface chip to connect to the keypad. Up to 16 keys can be used with this configuration. Library functions such as getKey(), peekKey() and getKeyCount() are included.

A demo program (in the examples folder) works with Arduino and Particle (Photon, Electron, and Core) microcontroller boards and it tests all of the functions in the I2cKeypad library.
